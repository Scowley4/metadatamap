# metadatamap
A webtool for topic modeling, with goals to allow users two main functions:
 - Classify documents by hand
 - Change anchor words (see [Arora et al.](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dsontag/papers/AroraEtAl_icml13.pdf)) and make tandem anchors (see [Lund et al.](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jbg/docs/2017_acl_multiword_anchors.pdf))
 
This tool implements the [Ankura](https://github.com/byu-aml-lab/ankura/) backend for corpus preparation, initial anchor finding, and classification.
